<div class="pagedescription">   Astronomers classify galaxies into three major categories: elliptical, spiral and irregular. These galaxies span a wide range of sizes,
     from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars.</div>

                    Can Galaxies Collide?
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    While the distances between galaxies seem large, so too are galaxies’ diameters.
                     Compared to stars, galaxies are relatively close to one another. They interact and even collide. 
                     When galaxies collide, they pass through each other; their stars don’t crash into each other
                      because of the immense distances between them. However, gravitational interactions between 
                      colliding galaxies could create new waves of star formation, supernovas and even black holes.
                       Collisions do distort a galaxy’s shape and computer models show that collisions between spiral
                        galaxies can eventually make ellipticals.

                <div class="description">
                    The appearance and make-up of galaxies are shaped over billions of years by interactions with groups of 
                    stars and other galaxies. While we don't know for certain how galaxies formed and took the many shapes
                     that we presently see, we have some ideas about their origins and evolution. Using supercomputers,
                      scientists can look back in time and simulate how a galaxy may have formed in the early universe and
                       grown into what we see today.

                    What Is Dark Matter?
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    In the late 1970s, astronomer Vera Rubin made the surprising discovery of dark matter. 
                    She was studying how galaxies spin when she realized the vast spiral Andromeda Galaxy seemed to be rotating 
                    strangely. In an apparent violation of Newton and Kepler’s Laws, the material at the galaxy’s
                     edges was moving just as fast as the material near the center, even though most of the mass 
                     she could see was concentrated at the center. Some extra non-visible mass, dubbed dark matter, 
                     appeared to be holding the galaxy together. She soon discovered that a huge halo of dark matter 
                     was present in galaxy after galaxy that she examined.
